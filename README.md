# infinite-pixel-theorem
This concept stems from the 'Infinite monkey theorem' which states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, including the complete works of William Shakespeare. This version uses random pixels to generate images of infinite events.
